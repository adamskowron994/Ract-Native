# Eliza

This project was bootstrapped with the command:

`npx create-remix@latest`

The above command scaffolds a Remix project with Rollup as its default module loader.

In addition, this project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager.

## Getting Started

### `pnpm start`

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Helpful Commands

### `pnpm run buf:generate`

Use `buf` to generate the compiled protos via protobuf-es

### `pnpm run build`

Build the app using Rollup.

### `pnpm run start:production`

Run the app in production mode.
